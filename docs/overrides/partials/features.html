              <p>
                Atomix isn't just a simple key-value store. The runtime API supports common data structures that can be used by
                applications to store and share state. Lists, maps, sets, and purpose-built data structures are provided to
                enable a variety of use cases.

                Primitives for solving common distributed systems problems like leader election, distributed locking, scheduling,
                and more. Atomix distributed coordination primitives enable developers to implement distributed systems solutions
                without distributed systems expertise.

              <p>
                The Atomix runtime is built on gRPC, enabling SDKs in a variety of different languages. Applications can be
                written in your language of choice, and containers or services can share state across languages.

              <h2>Storage abstraction layer</h2>
              <p>
                The Atomix runtime provides a unified API across numerous databases and protocols, decoupling application code from
                data stores to enable applications to be developed independent of the underlying architecture.

              <h2>Pluggable data stores</h2>
              <p>
                Atomix provides both custom distributed systems protocols and database proxies. Data storage is driven by
                configuration, so Atomix-enabled applications can choose their own data stores and even swap between data stores
                without changing a single line of code.

                Atomix is built from the ground up for Kubernetes. Data stores and applications are managed via custom
                resources, providing seamless integration with Kubernetes tools like kubectl and Helm.
